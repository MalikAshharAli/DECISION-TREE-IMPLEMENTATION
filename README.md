   *Decision Tree Implementation using Scikit-learn*
   
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn. The project demonstrates how decision trees can be used to classify or predict outcomes based on a chosen dataset.

  Project Objectives
  
1.Build a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn

2.Visualize the structure of the Decision Tree

3.Evaluate and analyze the modelâ€™s performance

4.Gain insights from the decision-making process of the model

  Contents 
  
1.decision_tree.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing:

2.Data preprocessing

3.Model training and evaluation

4.Tree visualization

5.Result analysis

  Visualization
  
The project includes visual representations of the trained decision tree to better understand how features are used for making decisions.

  Tools & Technologies
  
1.Python

2.Scikit-learn

3.Pandas

4.Matplotlib / Seaborn

5.Graphviz / Plotly ( for Visualization )

  Deliverables
  
1.A clean and well-documented notebook

2.Interactive and graphical visualization of the decision tree

3.Performance metrics and model interpretation

  Use Case
  
This implementation can be used as a starting point for classification problems using decision trees and is ideal for learning, academic purposes, or as a baseline for more advanced models.
