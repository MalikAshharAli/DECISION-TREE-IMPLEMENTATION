   *Decision Tree Implementation using Scikit-learn*
   
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn. The project demonstrates how decision trees can be used to classify or predict outcomes based on a chosen dataset.

  Project Objectives
Build a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn

Visualize the structure of the Decision Tree

Evaluate and analyze the modelâ€™s performance

Gain insights from the decision-making process of the model

  Contents
decision_tree.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing:

Data preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

Tree visualization

Result analysis

Sample dataset (or mention your dataset source)

  Visualization
The project includes visual representations of the trained decision tree to better understand how features are used for making decisions.

  Tools & Technologies
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Graphviz / Plotly (for visualization, if used)

  Deliverables
A clean and well-documented notebook

Interactive and graphical visualization of the decision tree

Performance metrics and model interpretation

  Use Case
This implementation can be used as a starting point for classification problems using decision trees and is ideal for learning, academic purposes, or as a baseline for more advanced models.
